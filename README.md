# NetCoreVideoUpload
Made a ASP.NET Core web app where you can upload and convert video files to .mp4 files. The website will dynamically list videos as you upload them to the site and it will store information about the video in the database

Simple ASP.NET Core project I did to see how to make a web app where you can upload, list and convert video files to .mp4 while also having a database backend that reads the files and stores file information.
